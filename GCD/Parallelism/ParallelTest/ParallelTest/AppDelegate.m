//    You can specify either a serial queue or a concurrent queue when calling dispatch_apply or dispatch_apply_f. Passing in a concurrent queue allows you to perform multiple loop iterations simultaneously and is the most common way to use these functions. Although using a serial queue is permissible and does the right thing for your code, using such a queue has no real performance advantages over leaving the loop in place.
